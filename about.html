                    <p>Our company would like to make a one stop shop for the people who are trying to be independent. We bring meals if the client wants meals already prepared or help them prepare their own meals. We perform housework chores that need to be done. We help with client’s personal care and tend to any of the homecare needs as well. If you need a ride to an appointment or to a store or just want to get out of the house we can do that for you as well. Our company will offer Registered / certified people (nurse or psw) to assist in accomplishing everyday tasks to help people stay in their homes and live independently.<br><br> Our company helps with everything from medical care, showers, house cleaning to bringing the client to appointments or even out to shop. As an attendant care service, our clients would reserve blocks of time with our certified people with pricing based on qualifications required. This would allow them to list whatever services they required that day, whether it is cleaning and care or just driving them to an appointment. Even if it is just someone to talk to or eat lunch with our services will cover anything they require. We will partner with trusted, bonded companies to even offer the overseeing of maintenance with their properties. Each and every client and their home will be our first priority.</p>

We are here for you. It will be the duty of every single employee to respect the client's wishes. No problem is too small or large for our company. We will be there not only to help with the client, but to take as much of the burden off of the families to alleviate the stress and time that is usually placed upon them. With our registered staff, we will be able to constantly monitor the client to be sure they are safe in their homes, properly nourished, medically cared for and even help with loneliness.</p>

Allowing you and your family to enjoy a worry free lifestyle, while being cared for. As a company dedicated to the clients needs, we hope to allow people to not only stay in their homes independently for longer, but help to take some burden off our ailing health care system. People allowed to live their life in familiar surroundings, will feel more dignified in their daily lives. Our vision is to see all of our clients happy and healthy living as independent as possible in their own surroundings.</p>

I am currently in school for nursing and am very passionate on what I do. I have started up this company all by myself. I have created this whole website and am very excited about it. I created this company because I have seen a lot of my family members struggle with trying to be independent and always waiting around for different companies. This company doesn’t just help the clients but helps out the family members because they can’t be there 24/7. Family members have a life to and we are here to make it easier on everyone!</p>
